/*
Doubly LinkedList Node has additional reference parameter
which points to the previous Node of Doubly Linked List.
previous of first node is null
and next of last node is null

Singly vs Doubly LinkedList
Advantages of Doubly Linked List:
1. Can be traversed in both direction (Real example would be browsing when next and previous both happens )
2. Delete a given node in O(1) with given refrence/pointer
3. Insert/Delete before a given node in O(1)
4. Insert/Delete from both ends in O(1) by maintaining tail
   In singly linked list even by maintaining tail we cannot delete from end in O(1)
   
What is a Deque (or double-ended queue) The deque stands for Double Ended Queue. 
   Deque is a linear data structure where the insertion and deletion operations are performed 
from both ends.

Deque is pronounced as deck


Disadvantages:
1. Extra Space for previous
2. Code becomes complex
