/*
In Circular LinkedList the next of last node refers to the head of the linkedlist.
Circular linked list can be singly circular or doubly circular.
We will see singly circular.
Advantages:
1. We can traverse the whole list from any node
2. Implementation of algorithm like Round Robin
3. we can insert at beginning and end, delete in beginning in O(1) just by maintaining tail

Disadvantages:
 Implementation of operations become complex
