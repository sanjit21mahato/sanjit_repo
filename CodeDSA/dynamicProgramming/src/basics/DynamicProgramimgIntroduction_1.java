Dynamic Programming in simple words is optimization over plain recursion. 
The idea of dynamic programming is to reuse the solutions of subproblems when 
there are overlapping subproblems.
There are two ways to impement dynamic programming.
Memoization (Top down)
Tabulation (Bottom up)

 Applications of Dynamic Programming
 Many real world problems and computer science problems are based on dynamic programming.
 1. Bellman Ford Algorithm: to find shortest path from source to all destinations. Algorithm is used in Routing
 2. Flyod Warshall Algorithm: to find shorted path between every pair of vertices in graph. 
 3. Diff Utility(LCS): Used in day to day life. Want to know differences between two files like while
                     committing in git. It based on dynamic programming called LCS(Longest Common Subsequence)
 4. Search Closed words(Edit Distance): Searching a word which is not in dictionary like mistyped searched word 
                          and want to find closest words. (Edit distance problem)
 5. Resource Allocation(0-1 knapsack): Have some budget and want somethings to acquire. how to make optimal decision.
